## A project to visualize Signals and Systems

MATLAB-Based Signals and Systems is a trainer for Communication Engineering students who want to study the behaviour of commonly used signals and systems. It helps students visualize the common signals after and before they are made to go through different systems.

The ***GUI*** and the ***program*** is written in **MATLAB** and MATLAB must be installed first for it to work properly

Note: I recommend using ***matlab 2019a*** for opening this file.
